Precise symbolic emulators of the linear and non-linear matter power spectra and for the conversion
$\sigma_8 \leftrightarrow A_{\rm s}$ as a function of cosmology.
Here we give the emulators as simple python functions and as a fortran90 routine, but these can be 
easily copied, pasted and modified to the language of your choice.
Please see
* [Bartlett et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15865) (Linear power spectrum) 
* [Bartlett et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17492) (Nonlinear power spectrum)
* [Sui et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14623) ($w_0-w_a$ and non-zero neutrino masses)
* [Kammerer et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14623) (Baryonic effects)
for further details.

For the linear and nonlinear LCDM emulators, by default, outside the k range tested in Bartlett et al. 2023, 
we use the Eisenstein & Hu fit which includes baryons. This can be switched off by setting
`extrapolate=False` in the functions `plin_emulated()`, `logF_max_precision()` and
`logF_fiducial()`. 


## Installation

To install the emulators and the dependencies, run the following

```
git clone git@github.com:DeaglanBartlett/symbolic_pofk.git
pip install symbolic_pofk
```

If you wish to use the pytorch code, the second line should be replaced with
```
pip install "symbolic_pofk[torch]"
```

If you wish to use the fortran version of the code, running the script
```
./setup_fortran.sh
```
will compile the fortran code and will produce a python wrapper for this.

## Examples

We give an example for how to use the Î›CDM
linear emulator in `examples/linear_example.py`.
and the nonlinear emulator in `examples/halofit_example.py`.
We show how to use the emulators for the extended cosmology
(including neutrino masses, w0 and wa) in `examples/syren_new_example.ipynb`.
And `examples/syren_baryon_example.ipynb` shows how to incorporate baryonic effects.

The example `examples/fortran_example.py` shows how to run the
fortran code with the python wrapper, and compares the difference
between the python and fortran implementations
(they are identical up to a fractional difference of
O(1e-6), which is much smaller than the error on the emulation).
